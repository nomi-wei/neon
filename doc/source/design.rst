Design Decisions
================

Computation backend
-------------------
* All objects inherit from ``NervanaObject`` which has a static ``be`` variable
  which is the computation backend being used (gpu or cpu).

  * ``be`` stores other important attributes like batch size and data type.
  * A backend must first be generated before running a model using ``gen_backend``.
  * If swapping backends, then buffers must be reinitialized by reinstantiating the
    model layers and calling fprop with the new generated backend.

Data Layout
-----------

Neon's layers internally store data as two-dimensional tensors. For convolution and pooling layers, the data
is formatted in :math:`(C, H, W, N)` layout (:math:`C` = channels, :math:`H` = height, :math:`W` = width, :math:`N` = batch size), and represented as a tensor of shape :math:`(F, N)`, where :math:`F = C * H *W`.

For recurrent layers, the time dimension :math:`T` is added to the :math:`N` dimension, so the data format is :math:`(F, T*N)`. The second dimension is ordered by incrementing the batch index first: :math:`t_1n_1, t_1n_2, ... t_1n_N, t_2n_1, t_2n_2, ...`

Layers
------
* Most layers are in layer.py, recurrent layers are in recurrent.py, and merge layers
  for concatenating or summing input are in merge.py.

Composite layers
'''''''''''''''''
* Some layers (for convenience) are composite layers made as lists of other layers.

  * Conv is a list of Convolution, Bias, and Activation layers
  * Affine is a list of Linear, Bias, and Activation layers
  * This allows flexibility in adding optional bias and activation layers without
    having to specify these as separate layers.

Layer buffer allocations
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
* Data buffers

  * A layer infers input shape from previous layers and initializes buffers accordingly.
  * Pre-allocating activation buffers allows buffer reuse and reduces memory usage.
  * Buffers will be reinitialized during the next fprop if the layer is reinstantiated.

* Parameter layers (``Linear``, ``Bias``, ``Convolution``, and ``BatchNorm``) maintain
  their own parameters ``W``, gradients ``dW``, and states ``states`` (for the optimizer).
* In general, layer buffer allocation is kicked off by the containing model, being
  called prior to the first ``fit`` or ``eval`` call.

Initialization
'''''''''''''''

* Weight initialization routines are in ``initializers.py`` and all have a
  ``fill`` method that describe how they will fill a given param buffer.
* The weight initialization object is passed to the layer constructor and
  the layer will fill the parameters during ``init_params``.

Models
------

Model container
''''''''''''''''
* The model provides a container of all the network layers and provides function calls
  to run and train the network.  It is also responsible for initializing and
  allocating layer parameter buffers.
* We can create a list of layers and give that to the model.
* When forward or backward propagation functions are called, the model will iterate
  through all the layers to forward pass the inputs and backward pass the errors.

Learning
''''''''
* When training the model, the following necessary components will be provided:

  * a training set object that can iterate over training data
  * an optimizer that applies to all the layer updates or a multi-optimizer that
    maps different optimizers to different layers by layer name
  * a cost function to compute the error
  * callback object that configures whether to use a validation set and how frequent
    in the training to validate, whether to get progress bar display, etc. For more
    information, see :doc:`neon fundamentals -- callbacks <callbacks>`.

* During update, the model sends a list containing all layers with learnable parameters
  to the optimizer.

  * The optimizer will then grab a tuple of ``(W, dW, state)`` from each layer and apply
    the updates.

Choice of sizes
---------------
* We will get better utilization if we pick more friendly sizes for batch size,
  sequence length, or feature size.
* Our GPU kernels are optimized for sizes being multiples of 4.
* In many of our examples, we use parameters from reference implementations. However,
  it is recommended to use multiples of 4. In many cases, zero-padding is needed to
  implement the same model.
