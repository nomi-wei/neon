Datasets
========

:py:class:`~.Dataset` class is a base class for commonly-used
datasets. We recommend creating an object class for your dataset that
handles the loading and preprocessing of the data. Datasets should
implement :py:meth:`~.Dataset.gen_iterators`, which returns a dictionary data
iterator used for training and evaluation (see :doc:`Loading
data <loading_data>`).

Neon provides dataset objects for handling many stock datasets.

MNIST
-----

`MNIST <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>`__, is a dataset of
handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training samples and 10,000
test samples. Each image is 28x28 greyscale pixels.

MNIST can be fetched in the following manner:

.. code-block:: python

    from neon.data import MNIST

    (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test), nclass = MNIST().load_data()
    train_set = ArrayIterator(X_train, y_train, nclass=nclass, lshape=(1, 28, 28))
    valid_set = ArrayIterator(X_test, y_test, nclass=nclass, lshape=(1, 28, 28))

CIFAR10
-------

`CIFAR10 <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html>`__, is a dataset
consisting of 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. There are
10 categories and each sample is a 32x32 RGB color image.

CIFAR10 can be fetched in the following manner:

.. code-block:: python

    from neon.data import CIFAR10
    (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test), nclass = CIFAR10().load_data()
    train = ArrayIterator(X_train, y_train, nclass=nclass, lshape=(3, 32, 32))
    test = ArrayIterator(X_test, y_test, nclass=nclass, lshape=(3, 32, 32))

ImageCaption
------------

This dataset uses precomputed CNN image features and caption sentences.
It works with the flickr8k, flickr30k, and COCO datasets and uses the
VGG image features and sentences from
http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/ which have been
converted to python .pkl format. These datasets have 5 reference
sentences per image. For each sentence, the dataset converts each word
to its 1-hot representation so that each input batch of sentences is of
dimension (vocab_size, max_sentence_length * batch_size).

The image caption data can be fetched in the following manner:

.. code-block:: python

    # download dataset
    from neon.data import Flickr8k
    data_path = Flickr8k().load_data()  # Other set names are Flickr30k and Coco

    # load data
    from neon.data import ImageCaption
    train_set = ImageCaption(path=data_path, max_images=-1)

Text
----

For existing datasets (e.g. Penn Treebank, Hutter Prize, and
Shakespeare), we have object classes for loading, and sometimes
pre-processing, the data. The online source are stored in the
``__init__`` method. Some datasets (such as Penn Treebank) also accept a
tokenizer (string) to parse the file. These datasets use ``gen_iterators()``
to return a iterator (:py:class:`Text<neon.data.text.Text>`)

.. code-block:: python

    from neon.data import PTB

    # download Penn Treebank and parse at the word level
    ptb = PTB(tokenizer="str.split")
    ptb.load_data()

    # create dict of iterators
    # iters['train'] is an iterator (neon.data.Text) for the training data
    # iters['test'] is an iterator for the testing data
    # iters['valid'] is an iterator for the validation data
    iters = ptb.gen_iterators()

ImageNet
--------

The raw images need to be downloaded from ILSVRC as a tar file. Because
the data is too large to fit in memory, the data must be loaded in
batches (called "macrobatches", see :doc:`Loading data <loading_data>`
). We first write the macrobatches with the
``batch_writer.py`` script. ``data_dir`` is where the
processed batches will be stored, and ``image_dir`` is where the
original tar files are saved.

.. code-block:: bash

    python neon/data/batch_writer.py  --data_dir /usr/local/data/tmp \
                                      --image_dir /usr/local/data/I1K/imagenet_orig \
                                      --set_type i1k

We then create the ImageNet dataset object and get the training data
iterator, which is of the :py:class:`.ImageLoader` class. :py:class:`.ImageLoader` allows
for fast loading and feeding of macrobatches to the model.

.. code-block:: python

    from neon.data import I1K

    # create the I1K object
    i1k = I1K(data_dir = args.data_dir, inner_size=224, subset_pct=100)

    # fetch a dict of iterators
    # iter['train'] is an iterator (neon.data.ImageLoader) for the training data
    # iter['val'] is an iterator for the validation data
    iters = i1k.gen_iterators()

QA and bAbI
-----------

A :py:class:`.bAbI` dataset object can be created by specifying which task and which
subset (20 tasks and 4 subsets in bAbI) to retrieve. The object will use
built-in metadata to get bAbI data from online sources, save and unzip
the files for that task locally, and then vectorize the
story-question-answer data. The training and test files are both needed
to build a vocabulary set.

A general question and answering container can take the
story-question-answer data from a bAbI data object and create a data
iterator for training.

.. code-block:: python

    # get the bAbI data
    babi = BABI(path='.', task='qa15_basic-deduction', subset='en')

    # create a QA iterator
    train_set = QA(*babi.train)
    valid_set = QA(*babi.test)
