neon
====

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

|neo|_ is Nervana_ â€™s Python-based deep learning library. It provides
ease of use while delivering the highest performance.

Features include:

* Support for commonly used models including convnets, RNNs, LSTMs, and
  autoencoders.  You can find many pre-trained implementations of these in our
  `model zoo`_
* Tight integration with our `state-of-the-art`_ GPU kernel library
* 3s/macrobatch (3072 images) on AlexNet on Titan X (Full run on 1 GPU ~ 32 hrs)
* Basic automatic differentiation support
* Framework for visualization
* Swappable hardware backends: write code once and deploy on CPUs, GPUs, or Nervana hardware

New features in this release:

* Python2/Python3 compatibility [#191]
* Support for Pascal GPUs
* Persistent RNN kernels [#262]
* Dataloader enhancements (audio loader with examples)
* HDF5 file data iterator
* Convolution kernel improvements
* Winograd kernel for fprop/bprop and 5x5 stride 1 filters
* API documentation improvements [#234, #244, #263]
* Cache directory cleanup
* Reorganization of all unit tests
* and `many more`_.

We use neon internally at Nervana to solve our `customers' problems`_
in many domains. Consider joining us. We are hiring across several
roles. Apply here_!
