# neon

[neon](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon) is Nervana's Python based
Deep Learning framework and achieves the [fastest performance](https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks) on modern deep neural networks such as AlexNet, VGG and GoogLeNet. Designed for ease-of-use and extensibility.

* [Tutorials](http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/tutorials.html) and [iPython notebooks](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/meetup) to get users started with using neon for deep learning.
* Support for commonly used layers: convolution, RNN, LSTM, GRU, BatchNorm, and more.
* [Model Zoo](https://github.com/nervanazoo/NervanaModelZoo) contains pre-trained weights and example scripts for start-of-the-art models, including: [VGG](https://github.com/nervanazoo/NervanaModelZoo/tree/master/ImageClassification/ILSVRC2012/VGG), [Reinforcement learning](https://github.com/nervanazoo/NervanaModelZoo/tree/master/DeepReinforcement), [Deep Residual Networks](https://github.com/nervanazoo/NervanaModelZoo/tree/master/SceneClassification/DeepResNet), [Image Captioning](https://github.com/nervanazoo/NervanaModelZoo/tree/master/ImageCaptioning), [Sentiment analysis](https://github.com/nervanazoo/NervanaModelZoo/tree/master/NLP/SentimentClassification/IMDB), and [more](http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/model_zoo.html).
* Swappable hardware backends: write code once and then deploy on CPUs, GPUs, or Nervana hardware

For fast iteration and model exploration, neon has the fastest performance among deep learning libraries (2x speed of cuDNNv4, see [benchmarks](https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks)).
* 2.5s/macrobatch (3072 images) on AlexNet on Titan X (Full run on 1 GPU ~ 26 hrs)
* Training VGG with 16-bit floating point on 1 Titan X takes ~10 days (original paper: 4 GPUs for 2-3 weeks)

We use neon internally at Nervana to solve our customers' problems across many
[domains](http://www.nervanasys.com/solutions/). We are hiring across several
roles. Apply [here](http://www.nervanasys.com/careers/)!

See the [new features](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon/blob/master/ChangeLog) in our latest release.

## Quick Install

* [Local install and dependencies](http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/installation.html)

On a Mac OSX or Linux machine, enter the following to download and install
neon (conda users see the [guide](http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/installation.html)), and use it to train your first multi-layer perceptron. To force a python2 or python3 install, replace `make` below with either `make python2` or `make python3`.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon.git
    cd neon
    make
    . .venv/bin/activate
    neon examples/mnist_mlp.yaml
    # alternatively, use a script:
    python examples/mnist_mlp.py
```
